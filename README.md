# Coffee Roasting Neural Network

This repository showcases a neural network model built in Python, leveraging both NumPy for numerical computations and TensorFlow for deep learning operations. The primary objective of this project is to classify different coffee roast levels—such as light, medium, or dark—based on two key input features: temperature and roasting duration.

The implementation is designed to demonstrate how fundamental machine learning concepts can be applied to a real-world use case. It walks through data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation, making it a valuable reference for beginners learning about neural networks as well as enthusiasts interested in applying AI to food science and roasting analytics.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic neural network that predicts whether a coffee bean is properly roasted based on its temperature and roasting duration. The implementation includes data preprocessing, normalization, forward propagation through a two-layer neural network, and visualization of the decision boundary.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 200 samples of coffee roasting data with the following features:
- **Temperature** (°F)
- **Roasting Duration** (minutes)
- **Label** (1: Properly roasted, 0: Not properly roasted)

The dataset is loaded using the `load_coffee_data()` function.

## Preprocessing
The data undergoes the following preprocessing steps:
1. **Normalization:** The temperature and duration are normalized using TensorFlow's `Normalization` layer.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Ensures all input features are within a common range for effective training.

## Neural Network
The neural network consists of two layers:
- **First Dense Layer**: Three neurons with a sigmoid activation function.
- **Second Dense Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

### Functions:
- `my_dense(a_in, W, b)`: Implements a fully connected layer.
- `my_sequential(x, W1, b1, W2, b2)`: Implements forward propagation through the two-layer network.
- `my_predict(X, W1, b1, W2, b2)`: Computes predictions for a given input.

## Usage
To test the model, run:
```python
X_tst = np.array([[200, 13.9], [200, 17]])  # Sample test data
X_tstn = norm_l(X_tst)  # Normalize test data
predictions = my_predict(X_tstn, W1_tmp, b1_tmp, W2_tmp, b2_tmp)
yhat = (predictions >= 0.5).astype(int)
print(f"decisions = \n{yhat}")
```
Expected output:
```
decisions =
[[1]
 [0]]
```

## Visualization
The decision boundary of the network is visualized using:
```python
netf = lambda x: my_predict(norm_l(x), W1_tmp, b1_tmp, W2_tmp, b2_tmp)
plt_network(X, Y, netf)
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```
